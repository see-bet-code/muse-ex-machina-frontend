**[Material Kit React](https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-kit-react/#/?ref=mkr-readme)** is a Free Material-UI Kit with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's material design and is was developed using [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app). You asked for it, so we built it. It's a great pleasure to introduce to you the material concepts in an easy to use and beautiful set of components. Along with the restyling of the Material-UI elements, you will find three fully-coded example pages, to help you design your next project.

**[Material Kit React](https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-kit-react/#/?ref=mkr-readme)** was built with the help of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and it uses a framework built by our friends from **[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)**, who did an amazing job creating the backbone for the material effects, animations, ripples and transitions. Big thanks to this team for the effort and forward thinking they put into it.
